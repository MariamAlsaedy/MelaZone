“Mela’Zone” is a website that enables you to detect early skin cancer, especially melanoma.
Where skin cancer is at the top of the list of cancerous infections, as for the type of melanoma, although it is only 3%, it causes deaths estimated at 75% of deaths, because its appearance causes the emergence of other types of cancer.
There are two main types of users of this website:
The first type, which is represented by the doctor, helps him/her in the early detection of the disease and exit from the maze of analyzes and experiments to save the patient. 
As for the second type, which is the patient in general, whether he/she is already suffering from this dreaded disease or just wants to check on his/her condition, he/she can use the website while he/she is at home without going anywhere.
Through a machine learning model where the user can scan an image and predict if the image is indeed melanoma or not.
The user can also undergo a simple test and the answers are yes or no to show him a statistical report if he is likely to be infected or contract the disease, in addition to some recommendations to prevent it.
